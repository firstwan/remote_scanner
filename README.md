# CFC Project - Remote Scanner
## Introduction
Reconnaissance is one of the most important parts of cybersecurity. No matter whether we are analyzing cyber attack incidents, or preparing to perform a pentest on our client. Reconnaissance typically involves issuing multiple commands to gather information about the target, which may result in frequent human typing errors. But luckily, most of the commands are repeated, which means we can automate the process

This project aims to reduce human error and increase efficiency. This project will include some of the most commonly used in reconnaissance. Some of the commands included connecting to a safe gateway, connecting to the private remote server, whois, nmap, etc.

At the end of the project, we will analyze one of the insecure protocols used in this project and provide an alternative secure version.
